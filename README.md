# World_Weather_Analysis

# Background


For the new modifications to the PlanMyTrip app, I need to asked more data to the database, or cities DataFrame, so that customers know the weather in the cities when they click on a pop-up marker. I Will also  to add the amount of rainfall or snowfall within the last three hours so that customers can filter the DataFrame using input statements based on the temperature range and whether or not it is raining or snowing. Finally, I wiil need to create a directions layer Google map that shows the directions between multiple cities for travel.


# Objectives:


The goals for this challenge:

* Use nested try-except blocks.


* Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.


* Create a new DataFrame from a new API search with new weather parameters.


* Filter DataFrames based on input and nested decision statements, and logical expressions.


* Create pop-up markers on a Google map from a filtered DataFrame.


* Add a directions layer on a Google map between cities in the filtered DataFrame.
